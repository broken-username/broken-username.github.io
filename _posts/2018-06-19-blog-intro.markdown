Hello everyone! So, it came to my attention github now makes it ridiculously fast and easy to create a static website and connect it to the outside world. Being the sort of person that I am, I jumped at the chance to do something I have always found fun in a new way.

And what better way to start out than by creating a blog that is all about my experiments in life? You see, I have a love of tinkering - the art of seeing the world through new eyes and using our creative abilities to understand and improve it. I tinker with a lot of things, from computers, to language, to ideas and philosophies. It's quite the journey. But a journey isn't much fun if you have no one with whom to share your story and successes. That's why I'd like to have you along for the ride. Consider yourself invited.
